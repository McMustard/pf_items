Instructions for filling out the item tables:
 1. Copy and paste data rows
 2. Be sure to include entries for sub-items, like Bane targets
 3. Condense multiple spaces into one
 4. Remove spaces before tabs
 5. If there's just one column of rolls, copy it for all three strengths.
 6. In place of missing columns, insert dashes
    Rods, Staves, Wondrous Items
 7. Insert name of table as leftmost column
 8. Insert subtypes as next-to-leftmost column
 X. Insert "Ring of " before ring types unless "ring" is in the title.
    Actually, we'll do this in software.
10. For potions, wands, and scrolls, remove the caster level column,
    and remove ordinal suffixes.
